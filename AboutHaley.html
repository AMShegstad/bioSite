                Haley is the youngest of eight siblings by a margin of at least thirteen years, but has grown up
                differently in just about every way. Most of us have been moving back and forth as children of deployed
                military servicemen and servicewomen. Haley has lived in the same state her entire life. Most of us grew
                up a father who was high on energy but low on temper. At 55, our father is now retired, extremely
                mellow, but low on energy. About half of us siblings, myself and Haley included, are of mixed race. She,
                however, is coming of age in an extremely tumultuous time in the same area events like the death of
                George Floyd happened. The rest of us grew up in a time where the internet was growing at an
                unprecedented pace, but not yet as instant and widespread as it is today. At her relatively young age of
                18 years old, she has been an activist and a scholar at levels that none of her siblings have.
                I watched Haley grow up from afar as I lived across the country for most of that time, but now
                being only thirty minutes away, I’m using this opportunity to both get my homework done and get to
                know her a bit better. Over the past year of living nearby and seeing here every couple of weeks, I have
                found that she is far cooler than any of her older siblings were at the same age. Like Jack Nicholson’s
                character in the opening lines of “The Departed”, her environment is a product of her influence, and not
                the other way around.
