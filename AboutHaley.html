                <strong> From the interview...</strong>
                <br>
                <br>
                Haley is working towards her own future, regardless of what that future holds. Proud of her
                independence and work ethic, she knows not exactly what she will be doing in the next five years, or
                even beyond, but she knows that she can achieve what she wants. A realist, she is aware that she likely
                will still be in college for some time, simultaneously working towards whatever lifestyle it is that she
                chooses. <br>
                She is a social person, both in person and otherwise. Always talking, she doesn’t have
                anything to hide, and if she wants you to know something, you’re going to hear straight from her. She
                also typically enjoys playing online games like Valorant and Fortnite. Despite the possible isolation
                afforded by sitting in front of a computer, Haley enjoys the social interaction allowed by these online
                offerings. Her other hobbies include card games like Pokemon and Magic: The Gathering, as well as
                sewing and creating clothing. She barely mentions drawing, but I’ve seen her work and can say it
                deserves more of praise than she thinks. <br>
                Haley graduated High School just last year in 2022. In her high school career, she excelled
                academically while also maintaining a high level of participation in her local community. She was a
                young activist in her school, and worked hard to introduce to a less-than-diverse community ideas of
                tolerance and inclusion. She earned the title of her school’s “Husky of the Year” for 2022, which came
                with a small trophy (It was a brick… yeah, I don’t understand but she was happy) and a $2000
                scholarship prize. <br>
                Does she have a catch phrase? If she did it would be “Slay!”. (Please note the "!". I think it's important...)
                <br>
                <br>
                <strong> My Own Thoughts </strong>
                <br>
                <br>
                Haley is the youngest of six (6) siblings, and she has come of age
                in a very different time than the rest of us. Sure, her older siblings grew up in the nineties and early two-thousands,
                and got to watch the world change as reliance on the internet grew and grew, but the world we live in today (and the one
                in which she has grown up) appears to be a product of the internet instead of the other way around.
                <br>
                <br>
                Haley is civic-minded individual, whose potential future careers include politics, law, and even genealogy. She is a gamer, a barista, 
                and a pretty cool sister. Not all of her sibilings took their education seriously, but she is definitely an avid learner.
                I'd say that she is in fact the most scholarly of all the siblings.
                <br>
                <br>
                In my opinion, she's also freaking hilarious!
