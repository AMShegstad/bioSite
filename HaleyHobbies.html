                <p> She also likes to play the free-to-play third-person shooter Fortnite, in which players compete to be
                    the last avatar(s) standing, either alone or with friends. It's even jam-packed with licensed characters
                    and vehicles to customize to your liking.

                        she enjoys the show Breaking Bad (I'm still working on my first watching of the show. It's good... but slow...)
