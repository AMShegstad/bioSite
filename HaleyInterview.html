            <h1> Some good 'ol Q & A with Haley </h1>

            <div id="aboutParagraph"> 
                <p>
                    Haley is my younger sister, and as the youngest of several siblings by more than a decade, she has 
                    a vastly different experience growing up than the rest of us did. I myself had a very different experience 
                    than did my two older siblings, but not due to a difference in age, but location. She and I share come marked
                     similarities and at other times couldn't be more different. Having just started 
                    her college experience in 2022, Haley is a recent high school graduate who's world can sometimes seem 
                    unfamiliar to me. For this reason, I was very excited to ask some fun questions and hear her responses.
                    Check them out for yourself below and get to know Haley!
